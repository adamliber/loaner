Connecting you to the things you need in your neighborhood. Like a free and for sale community except for borrowing.

Need a camera but don’t want to buy or rent one?
Loaner helps you find friends and neighbors that you can borrow from. Give back to the community and post your own things you don’t use often collecting dust in your garage.
